    "This project aims to make a model that can find the underlying factors that contribute to a person's financial health and how different demographics may affect the financial health. We will be using the UCI bank marketing data set to obtain demographic information. We will be using Support Vector Machine model and K Nearest Neighbors multiclass classification to predict bank account balances, with the possibly of using Principle Component Analysis to determine the most significant contributors to financial status. We will be using confusion matrix, F1 score, ROC-AUC score, learning curve, and AIC and BIC score comparison to evaluate model performance."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Making money and having a large bank account balance is a goal that many strive for. But what factors contribute to how much money people have in their accounts? There's the obvious job type and age that typically have an impact on salary and thus bank account balnce, but what other attributes have an influence, and to what degree?\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been studies on how different demographics affect salary or bank account balance. For example, an article by ValuePenguin breaks down how income and age affect balances. Unsuprisingly, as income increases, the average balance increases. In addition, balance increases as age increases up to the 65-74 age range, but after 75+ years, the average balance decreases <a name=\"moon\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#moonnote).\n",
    "There are also a multitude of studies that have looked at how different personal attributes affect earnings. While earnings are not exactly bank account balance, we have already seen how income affect the balance. A report by Social Security found that men with bachelor's degrees earn about \\\\$900,000 more during their lifetime than men with only high school diplomas. For women, the difference is about \\\\$630,000. The report then took into account certain socio-demographic variables that could influence earnings; after recalculations, men and women with bachelor's  degrees earn \\\\$655,000 and \\\\$450,000, repectively, more than their high school graduate counterparts <a name=\"social\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#socialnote). Further, Social Security looks into how savings are affected by marital status. It was found that married people were much more likely to have an individual retirement account (IRA) or defined contribution (DC). This likely means that married people are better at saving money due to multiple reasons. Cost sharing, long term commitment, and future-focused behavior may be contributers to this behavior <a name=\"relationship\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#relationshipnote).\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to analyze not only what attributes collectively contribute to bank account balance, but also how much influence each attribute has. The goal of our research and analysis is to find what demographics and lifestyle choices correlate to bank account balances. While the results of this research are intended to be informative knowledge, they could serve as guidance to increase bank account balance. This information could also be used for banks to determine what clients to focus on."
